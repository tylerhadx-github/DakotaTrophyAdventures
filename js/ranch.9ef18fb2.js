Wasta, South Dakota, is owned and operated by Tom and Sheila Trask along with their children, Mark, Mick, and Tomilyn. Encompassing nearly 20,000 acres along the Cheyenne and Elk Creek tributaries, the ranch serves as the foundation for Dakota Trophy Adventuresâ€”a versatile business dedicated to hunting and outdoor recreation. From trophy Mule Deer and Whitetail to Antelope and Merriam turkeys, as well as fossils, fihsing and predator control thermal hunts! Dakota Trophy Adventures offers diverse hunting experiences. In addition to hunting, the ranch includes cattle, registered quarter horses, and personal hunting trips spanning from Alaska to Africa, various provinces in Canada, numerous western United States, and as far south as New Zealand and Australia. Dakota Trophy Adventures excels in helping clients discover exceptional hunting areas and enjoy the great outdoors. We take pride in providing excellent recommendations for outfitters we have hunted with worldwide. ")]),a("p",[e._v(" The Trask Family resides on a prairie ranch in South Dakota, a property with deep roots tracing back to Tom's parents, Mark and Winnie Trask. Tom Trask, born and raised in the Elm Springs area, has a familial connection to the land that goes back generations. His father played a pivotal role in establishing a commercial hunting operation in 1965, complementing their ranching activities in the Elm Springs region. Tom's grandfather, Mack Trask, homesteaded at the forks of the Cheyenne and Belle Fourche rivers, just north of our current location. Growing up in a family deeply involved in ranching and hunting, Tom spent winters trapping with his father and summers hunting fossils with his mother. He attended the local country school in Meade County, where his enthusiasm for sharing hunting adventures became well-known. Even during high school in Sturgis, Tom's passion for the ranching and hunting lifestyle persisted. Following his high school graduation, Tom briefly attended college at SDSU. However, his return home during Christmas revealed the challenges his family and cattle faced in a tough winter, prompting him to dedicate his efforts to their needs. This commitment underscored Tom's deep connection to both the land and the responsibilities that came with it. ")]),a("p",[e._v(" After partnering with his brother for a few years, Tom decided to separate the operation in 1985. In 1986, Tom married Shelia McDaniel, and together, they have continued to ranch and expand both the ranching and outfitting businesses. Shelia's roots are in the northeast of Philip, SD, where she grew up on a cattle and sheep ranch. Her early education took place in a rural school, and she later attended high school in Philip. During her country school days, the boy-to-girl ratio was 13-1, leading Shelia to embrace activities traditionally associated with boys, such as riding horseback to school and hunting rabbits along the way. Following her graduation, Shelia pursued higher education at SDSU and ultimately graduated from BHSU with a degree in business and education. ")]),a("p",[e._v(" In 1987, Tom assumed the role of booking for Dakota Trophy and has since expanded its services into other areas, including turkey hunts, antelope hunts, and archery hunting. Beyond the realm of hunting, both locally and globally, our endeavors involve putting up hay, raising cattle, and maintaining a select group of quarter horses. It's a common sight to witness the entire family actively engaged, whether in a hay field operating machinery or in a pasture or corral tending to the cattle. ")]),a("p",[e._v(" Tom and Shelia are proud parents of three children. In 1989, after serving hunters dinner, Tom rushed Shelia to the hospital where Mark was born prematurely â€“ a fact that might be surprising given his robust health today. Mick followed in 1991, and Tomilyn in 1993. They all attended the local rural school until Mark transitioned to high school, prompting the decision to send all three to school in Philip. Each of them graduated from Philip High School. Following high school, Mark and Mick embarked on brief college careers and attended taxidermy school. Presently, both are back home, actively involved in ranching, hunting, and practicing taxidermy. Tomilyn pursued higher education, earning a degree in Mathematics Education, but has found that teaching is not her calling! She currently resides at home, contributing to ranch activities and handling booking and paperwork for Dakota Trophy. During your time at Dakota Trophy, you'll find all three siblings guiding, cooking, managing skinning and caping, and participating in meat processing. The Trask family has been blessed with two grandchildren, Levi and Annie, both attending the same rural school that Tom, Mark, Mick, and Tomilyn did. Levi, born in 2010, and Annie, born in 2014, reside on the ranch, actively assisting whenever they can, balancing their time between school and other activities.
