We offer coyote calling in the daylight or at night using thermal equipment. All predator control hunts take place on private land and are generally run in late fall or winter. We can run calling/trapping hunts from early from Oct 20-31. After deer season, we will do calling/trapping or baited hunts from Dec 15-Mar 15. Most hunters will have the opportunity to harvest coyotes, racoons, porcupine, badger, and/or fox during their hunt. We prefer to take groups of up to 6 to make sure that we have enough thermal equipment for everyone to have ample opportunity to shoot. If you have proper equipment for thermal hunting, you are welcome to bring your own, otherwise we will provide rifles and thermal equipment for these hunts. You will be guided in groups of 2. We can take a single person if you are a lone hunter. Most thermal hunts will be 3 days/nights but can be customized for whatever suits your schedule and interest. We recommend a minimum of 3 days/nights to help avoid undesirable weather, wind, or moon ")])])],1)],1)],1)],1),a("hr"),a("shared-footer")],1)},o=[],n=a("da79"),l={components:{SharedFooter:n["a"]}},i=l,s=a("2877"),c=a("6544"),u=a.n(c),d=a("b0af"),h=a("99d9"),p=a("62ad"),f=a("0e8f"),m=a("0fd9"),w=Object(s["a"])(i,r,o,!1,null,null,null);t["default"]=w.exports;u()(w,{VCard:d["a"],VCardText:h["b"],VCardTitle:h["c"],VCol:p["a"],VFlex:f["a"],VRow:m["a"]})}}]);
