The previous year I had gone on a guided mule deer hunt in another state and didn’t see a single mature buck during 5 days of hunting. I was nervous that the same thing might happen again. To my surprise, I saw at least 5 mature “shooter-type” bucks on my first day of hunting. I would have been delighted to take any of these bucks, but my guide Mark Trask kept saying he thought we could find something better. Eventually, we found a buck we both agreed was phenomenal. I harvested an old mature 28” wide 170+ buck and I could not be more delighted. Dakota Trophy Adventures is not your average outfitter. It is clear that during their 50+ years of outfitting that they have carefully managed both the quantity and quality of bucks on their lands. I literally saw several hundred mule deer while there with more than 20 being 5+ year old bucks. In addition to their outstanding management, the outfitter, guides, and staff are hardworking, professional, and gracious. The accommodations were great and the food was excellent. I am already looking forward to my next hunt with them!",author:"Mitch Engle"},{images:[898],content:"I've hunted with Dakota Trophy five times over the past eight years.  I've always had a great time with the Trasks.  I have always hunted white-tail deer with great success.  My trophies have scored from 138- 162. The first year or so my problem was not passing the 140 deer.  Since then, the last three bucks have been over 150.  Any hunter who can shoot( and pass 140 bucks) has a real chance at a monster. I have hunted alot of places throughout the west and have never been to a place with so much game and so many trophy bucks. The food is first class and the folks at Dakota Trophy have become great friends.",author:"P. Rutt-- Wyoming (originally from Pennsylvania)"},{images:[1401],content:"I’ve been out to the Trask Family ranch twice to hunt Merriam turkeys. I can attest to why they call it a “family” ranch. Once you meet Tom, Shelia and the kids, you become family. They always make the trip worth wild and never fail to put you on birds to hunt. If you’re looking to go to a place where you can’t see a neighbor’s lights at night or hear the hum of traffic on the nearby road, this is your place. The night skies are lit up by the stars and you may wake up to snow in April. You’ll get to hunt your bird all alone or with help if needed. You’ll see plenty of other game like mule deer and whitetail. You’ll likely find some sheds or maybe even a fossil. If your up for a real adventure, hop on a side by side with the owner, Tom Trask, and go round up some cattle. The family will most likely be working on the ranch while you hunt, but always take time to make sure you’re well fed and enjoying your stay. Id recommend the turkey hunting for adults and kids. On one trip, my party had an 80 plus year old trying to complete his grand slam. He couldn’t get around like he could in his younger days, but the Trasks made sure to do everything possible to get his bird, and they did. It was a special moment shared by many that weekend.",author:"Chad Lott"},{images:[118],content:"I've hunted turkeys with these fine folks several times and what an awesome experience I had each time.

Dakota Trophy is as good as any and better than most.",author:"Arlen Vacura"},{images:[1327,86],content:"I have hunted with Dakota Trophy Hunt about ten years. I have taken many trophy bucks, both mule deer and whitetail. Hunters can expect to see many deer during their stay and will have numerous opportunities to harvest a trophy. I have taken mule deer bucks in the 180-185 B.&C. range, the widest being 29 1/2 inches. I have also taken a mule deer buck with 29 inch main beams. So far as whitetail goes I have taken many trophy bucks. 10 pointers are usually the norm. My bucks have been in the 150 B.&C. range. There are many taken each year larger. In fact I have seen 16 pointers come into camp, as well as 7x7 typical bucks. This area of drainages is one of the best areas on the continent to hunt. I have hunted in Alberta, Sask., Wyoming, Montana, Maine, New York, and South Carolina. South Dakota is my favorite by far. Dakota Trophy has built new camps last year and are very comfortable. The food is always great. Airport pick-up is included in the price. The ranchers in this coalition have a common goal, to produce trophy animals and put their hunters in position for a shot. The walls of my trophy rooms are a testament to this commitment. Overall on a scale of 1 to 10, Dakota Trophy Hunt gets a ten every time.",author:"Bob D."},{images:[511],content:"Having hunted several different areas across the west  it seems that most of the prime trophy areas produce a few huge bucks but overall quality isn't that good and a lot of times not seeing any deer at all if the migration didn’t happen due to weather. I have only hunted with Tom for two years but in those two years he has ran 100 percent on mule deer and their wasn’t any dinks each year I seen mature bucks taken over that  30 inch mark getting one myself that went 29 all mature heavy horned bucks usually with some trash and always one or two 180 plus.

I have hunted different states for mule deer and white tail as well -Dakota Trophy is the Best.  My experience there rates extremely high.  First off the guides will do their utmost to satisfy you, sometimes the weather might be a problem as anywhere you hunt can be.  The accommodations, sleeping quarters & bating are good and comfortable.  The game has been on the upswing since my first hunt in 1997.  I have hunted there for 10 years - 2010 will be my 11th year.  Last but not least the food is rated up with the best of hunting camps.  I highly recommend Dakota Trophy for their accomplishments.",author:"Clarence M. Petaluma CA"},{content:"About Dakota Trophy Hunting: I can sum up my opinion with one word. IMPRESSIVE!  I have reflected a lot on my trip to your outfit and cannot find anything negative to say. The Mule Deer were plentiful and had well endowed racks. The Whitetail I saw were very good as well, and I was there before the rut brings out the biggest and baddest. The Linn brothers, Andy and Mo, were friendly and accommodating. Their ranch is expansive and holds unfathomable quantities of game. I not only saw hundreds of deer, but coyotes, prairie dogs, sharp-tail grouse, and other species as well. The ranch house we were housed in was warm, dry, and well suited to a hunting camp. It sure beats tent living or the vermin infested places I have stayed with other outfitters.  The meals were out of this world. Steaks (twice), prime rib, turkey, ribs, pork loin, and taco salads in the evening along with appetizers and an open bar! Lunches and breakfasts were hot and delicious. Anyone looking for a quality hunting experience need look no further. I have already made plans to return in 2 years (next year was already booked). I have recommended your outfit to my brother, cousin, several friends, and acquaintances.",author:"Mark S.

We have had 100% success with taken Mule Deer up to 193  & Whitetails in the 160's. The quantity and quality of deer here is unbelievable do to a high management program. They distribute the hunters over several thousand acres and allocate only a few hunters to each ranch making for a quality hunt. The accommodations have improved and the meals are incredible, all the Guides are fun and friendly it's a family atmosphere, this is a hunt we look forward to every year.
