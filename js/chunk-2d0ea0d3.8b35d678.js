We have been hunting rifle deer since 1965. The rifle deer season is a 16-day season in November. We run three hunts during the season. All rifle deer hunts are four days in length and fully guided. As a guest of Dakota Trophy Hunt, more than 140,000 acres of rugged country along the Belle Fourche and Cheyenne Rivers are reserved exclusively for you. The hills and draws of these river breaks provide abundant habitat for deer. Large numbers of Mule Deer range in the breaks, while Whitetail range on the bottom land. During your hunt in this "deer country" you will not see any other hunters except those in your party. But you will see trophy deer every day and you will have opportunities to harvest. Your hunt will take place on private property. The philosophy of Dakota Trophy Hunt is conservation of game. Therefore, we encourage you to shoot only a four point or better trophy buck (Western Count). We want to take only those bucks who have reached maturity and sport a true trophy class rack and thereby preserve a vigorous herd of deer so that year after year we can offer a trophy buck. Methods of hunting will vary according to which rancher/guide you hunt with and terrain. We can accommodate anyone from the most vigorous mountain hiker to the physically handicapped sportsman. Transportation to and from camp and one hunting area to another will generally be by a pickup or suburban. From there most hunts are spot and stalk. Dakota Trophy Hunt will take care of all your needs during your hunt. Three delicious meals will be served each day and hunters always rave about the food. If you are hunting some distance from the kitchen, you will take noon lunch with you. Your rancher/guide will have you back in camp in time for a steak or prime rib type of dinner at night. While hunting you will see numerous bucks and will have no problem scoring, if your rifle is zeroed in and you have practiced with it. Sight your rifle in for 100-yard or 200-yard shots, depending on what you are accustomed to.

We also have an outstanding taxidermist available with reasonable rates. Many of our hunters use this option when they have availability. Some hunters choose to drive their own automobile to our camp while others fly into Rapid City to be picked up and taken back by Dakota Trophy. Since our hunting facilities are limited, we book only the number of hunters that each rancher can fill with trophy bucks. We book early and are years out!
