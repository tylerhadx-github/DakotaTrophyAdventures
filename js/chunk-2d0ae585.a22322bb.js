We offer custom family friendly adventures for the outdoor enthusiasts that also love rocks, fossils, minerals, and crystals. Come discover what was in the ocean about 73.5 million years ago. On Elk Creek in South Dakota, we find many colorful ammonite species including scaphites, baculites, Placenticeras, nautilus, and the giant clam. We also find large septarian concretions filled with minerals like calcite or golden barite, and often with a cephalopod preserved in the center. The species are often preserved with their very colorful and iridescent shell still unaltered and intact. The rainbow colors of their shell make them one of the most desirable fossils for collectors. These adventures can be customizable to suit each person or family. Generally, we run these from mid-July-September but can usually add on a little fossil hunting to another adventure.
