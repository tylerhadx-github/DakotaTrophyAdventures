        "The river breaks and creek bottoms of western SD are home to an unbelievable number of Merriam turkeys. We offer turkey hunts mainly on the home place and a few surrounding ranches. We can hunt over 60,000 acres of private land to make sure you have the best opportunity at a trophy Merriam. Our hunters enjoy unequalled success year in and year out. Many trophies are eligible for the record book. <br> We currently hold 2 of the top 5 spots for Merriam turkeys in the record book â€“ and yes, there is a record book for turkeys! Turkey season opens in mid April and runs through the end of May. We prefer to take our hunters on the weekends. Our turkey hunts are 3 day semi-guided hunts. We do one bird hunts with the option to take a second bird on a trophy fee. We can offer full-guided hunts upon request for an extra fee. We provide you with a vehicle (usually an ATV) to hunt with.",
