      <p>
        The Spanish Five Ranch in Wasta, South Dakota, is owned and operated by
        Tom and Sheila Trask along with their children, Mark, Mick, and Tomilyn.
        Encompassing nearly 20,000 acres along the Cheyenne and Elk Creek
        tributaries, the ranch serves as the foundation for Dakota Trophy
        Adventures—a versatile business dedicated to hunting and outdoor
        recreation. From trophy Mule Deer and Whitetail to Antelope and Merriam
        turkeys, Dakota Trophy Adventures offers diverse hunting experiences. In
        addition to hunting, the ranch includes cattle, registered quarter
        horses, and personal hunting trips spanning from Alaska to Africa,
        various provinces in Canada, numerous western United States, and as far
        south as New Zealand and Australia. Dakota Trophy Adventures excels in
        helping clients discover exceptional hunting areas and enjoy the great
        outdoors. We take pride in providing excellent recommendations for
        outfitters we have hunted with worldwide.

        The Trask Family resides on a prairie ranch in South Dakota, a property
        with deep roots tracing back to Tom's parents, Mark and Winnie Trask.
        Tom Trask, born and raised in the Elm Springs area, has a familial
        connection to the land that goes back generations. His father played a
        pivotal role in establishing a commercial hunting operation in 1965,
        complementing their ranching activities in the Elm Springs region. Tom's
        grandfather, Mack Trask, originally homesteaded at the forks of the
        Cheyenne and Belle Fourche rivers, just north of our current location.
        Growing up in a family deeply involved in ranching and hunting, Tom
        spent winters trapping with his father and summers hunting fossils with
        his mother. He attended the local country school in Meade County, where
        his enthusiasm for sharing hunting adventures became well-known. Even
        during high school in Sturgis, Tom's passion for the ranching and
        hunting lifestyle persisted. Following his high school graduation, Tom
        briefly attended college at SDSU. However, his return home during
        Christmas revealed the challenges his family and cattle faced in a tough
        winter, prompting him to dedicate his efforts to their needs. This
        commitment underscored Tom's deep connection to both the land and the
        responsibilities that came with it.

        After partnering with his brother for a few years, Tom decided to
        separate the operation in 1985. In 1986, Tom married Shelia McDaniel,
        and together, they have continued to ranch and expand both the ranching
        and outfitting businesses. Shelia's roots are in the northeast of
        Philip, SD, where she grew up on a cattle and sheep ranch. Her early
        education took place in a rural school, and she later attended high
        school in Philip. During her country school days, the boy-to-girl ratio
        was 13-1, leading Shelia to embrace activities traditionally associated
        with boys, such as riding horseback to school and hunting rabbits along
        the way. Following her graduation, Shelia pursued higher education at
        SDSU and ultimately graduated from BHSU with a degree in business and
        education.

        In 1987, Tom assumed the role of booking for Dakota Trophy and has since
        expanded its services into other areas, including turkey hunts, antelope
        hunts, and archery hunting. Beyond the realm of hunting, both locally
        and globally, our endeavors involve putting up hay, raising cattle, and
        maintaining a select group of quarter horses. It's a common sight to
        witness the entire family actively engaged, whether in a hay field
        operating machinery or in a pasture or corral tending to the cattle.

        Tom and Shelia are proud parents of three children. In 1989, after
        serving hunters dinner, Tom rushed Shelia to the hospital where Mark was
        born prematurely – a fact that might be surprising given his robust
        health today. Mick followed in 1991, and Tomilyn in 1993. They all
        attended the local rural school until Mark transitioned to high school,
        prompting the decision to send all three to school in Philip. Each of
        them graduated from Philip High School. Following high school, Mark and
        Mick embarked on brief college careers and attended taxidermy school.
        Presently, both are back home, actively involved in ranching, hunting,
        and practicing taxidermy. Tomilyn pursued higher education, earning a
        degree in Mathematics Education. She currently resides at home,
        contributing to ranch activities and handling booking and paperwork for
        Dakota Trophy. During your time at Dakota Trophy, you'll find all three
        siblings guiding, cooking, managing skinning and caping, and
        participating in meat processing. The Trask family has been blessed with
        two grandchildren, Levi and Annie, both attending the same rural school
        that Tom, Mark, Mick, and Tomilyn did. Levi, born in 2010, and Annie,
        born in 2014, reside on the ranch, actively assisting whenever they can,
        balancing their time between school and other activities.

        In conjunction with hunting, preserving trophies is an integral part of
        our endeavors. Tom has engaged in taxidermy for our purposes, and
        currently, Mark and Mick have taken up the craft after studying under
        Tom Matuska at the Northwest Iowa School of Taxidermy. Their work in
        taxidermy is primarily undertaken during the winter months or whenever
        they find time between their ranching commitments. For more details
        about Dakota Trophy Taxidermy, please explore the Taxidermy tab!
